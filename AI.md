# AI Disclosure for ValidCheck

This document provides transparent disclosure of artificial intelligence (AI) usage in the
ValidCheck project.

## AI Usage Declaration

**Level of AI Involvement:** Primarily Human with AI Assistance

ValidCheck was developed collaboratively between human developers and AI systems, with human
oversight and decision-making throughout the development process.

## AI Tools Used

- **Claude (Anthropic)** - Claude-3.5-Sonnet and Claude-4-Sonnet models
- **Usage:** Code generation assistance, documentation writing, and refactoring suggestions

## What AI Was Used For

### Core Logic (Human-Written)

- **Validation algorithms and business logic** - Designed and implemented by human developers
- **API design and architecture** - Human-directed decisions
- **Security and error handling strategy** - Human-designed and validated

### AI-Assisted Development

- **Code generation** - AI generated initial code structure, all reviewed and modified by humans
- **Documentation** - AI generated JavaDoc comments, all reviewed for accuracy
- **Testing** - AI assisted with test case generation, human-verified for completeness
- **Refactoring** - AI suggested improvements (e.g., renaming `logActualValue` to
  `includeActualValue`)

## Human Oversight

All AI-generated content was:

- **Reviewed** by human developers
- **Modified** as needed for correctness and quality
- **Tested** to ensure functionality
- **Validated** against Java best practices

Human developers maintain full responsibility for code correctness, security, and API design.

## Quality Assurance

- All code compiles without warnings
- Comprehensive test suite with full coverage
- All documentation examples verified to work
- Follows established Java coding standards

---

**All code and documentation generated by AI have been thoroughly reviewed and validated by human
developers.**
